# SciStream Responsive Layout

## *Overview* 🌟

This project is part of the Responsive Design module in [**Scrimba**](https://v2.scrimba.com/home)’s [**Frontend Career Path**](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) course. The goal is to create a science streaming layout that is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid.

The layout includes an advanced grid structure that dynamically changes according to screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop). This approach ensures that elements are organized in an intuitive and visually appealing way on any device.

## *What I learned* 🤓

🔳 **Grid Structure:**

+ `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`: defined the layout of columns and rows for different devices.
+ `span`: used this property to make specific elements span across multiple columns or rows, improving visual organization.
+ `grid-column` and `grid-row`: controlled the start and end points of elements within the grid.
+ Grid Lines: optimized content alignment based on grid lines.

🔳 **Responsive Design:**

+ `grid-template-areas`: created specific content areas for an intuitive and easily modifiable structure.
+ `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`: automatically handled the number of columns based on available space.
+ `minmax()`: allowed elements to adjust their minimum and maximum size based on container width.
+ The `fr` unit: distributed space proportionally across the grid.

🔳 **Auto Layout & Flow:**

+ `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-flow`: configured content flow and automatic row sizing.
+ `dense`: optimized filling of empty spaces to maintain a compact layout.

🔳 **Other Key Concepts:**

+ `gap`: controlled spacing between rows and columns.
